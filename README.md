## Test Pages

Many of the examples from the documentation site are included here as stand-alone pages with just the bare minimum code needed to demonstrate the specific features in each (i.e. no Bootstrap, no extra module dependencies like ngRouter, etc).

These pages were created before the docs site, and may not be up to date.

These pages are served when you run the `gulp` task and are accessible from the root (i.e. `http://localhost:9002/simple-map.html`).
