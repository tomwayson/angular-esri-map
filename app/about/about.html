        <h1>Zen of Directives and Maps</h1>
        <p>You have probably noticed that these are very, very simple directives. For example - there is no way to apply styles to the feature layers, nor is there support for any of the 20+ other layers supported by the Esri Javascript API. This was not an oversight, it was by design.</p>
        <p>We feel that the value of directives (or web components for that matter) is to package up complex components, exposing a limited, simple declarative interface as html-elements &amp; attributes. Attempting to encapsulate all the layers, renderers, symbols and events of the JS API in a set of directives would simply add more bulk to the javascript, and create another complex api to learn and support.
        </p>
        <p>Instead, we are providing a small set of re-usable directives. If your application has modest mapping needs, these directives may be useful as-is. If your application makes use of some of the more advanced features of the Esri JavaScript API, then the directives in this repo should demonstrate the patterns that will help you create your own directives.</p>
        <h2>Roll Your Own Directives</h2>
        <p>We believe that you will have the best success integrating maps with your angular applications if you build directives that focus on your problem domain.
        </p>
        <p>For example - suppose you are building an application for a local government. There is a very good chance that you would be integrating a few standard types of maps. Using the examples provided in this repo you could create directives like...</p>
        <div hljs no-escape>
&lt;parcel-map pin=&quot;ABC123&quot;&gt;&lt;/parcel-map&gt;
&lt;lot-layout-map lot=&quot;93920-A-23&quot;&gt;&lt;/lot-layout-map&gt;
&lt;workorder-map order=&quot;10-31-14-002&quot;&gt;&lt;/workorder-map&gt;
        </div>
        <p>These directives could be easily integrated into any views in the over-arching application, or even shared across a suite of applications.
        </p>

        <h2>Some thoughts on Angular...</h2>
        <p>At Esri we use a number of different javascript application frameworks, including Angular. While we find that using Angular can lead to huge productivity increases, and massively streamlined code - it is worth noting that Angular is not a silver bullet for all types of web applications.
        </p>
        <p>Where we have seen the greatest benefit is in situations where the majority of the application functionality is "forms-over-data", with a few maps added in. Similarly, when we have tried to use Angular on single-page, full-screen mapping applications, we have found ourselves working against the framework.
        </p>
        <p>So, as the old saying goes
            <em>use the right tool for the job!</em>
