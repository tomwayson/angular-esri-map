        <h2>Getting a Reference to the Map and Scene Views</h2>
        <p>The map and scene view directives include function binding (events)
            as a way for you to get direct references to the underlying map and
            scene view objects from a parent controller. This will allow you to
            manipulate those objects in ways beyond what is allowed by the
            declarative directive API.</p>
        <h3>Events</h3>
        <p>The map and scene view directives each include both <code>on-create</code>
            and <code>on-load</code> events that pass a reference to the underlying map or
            scene view object to a callback function. The <code>on-create</code> event is
            fired immediately after the view has been created (i.e. <code>new MapView()</code>)
            and the <code>on-load</code> event fires after the view's
            <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/beta/api-reference/esri-views-MapView.html#then">promise has been resolved</a>.
        </p> 
        <p>The map and scene view directives also include an <code>on-error</code> event
            that passes the error information object if a view's promise has been rejected.
            This can be useful, for example, if you wish to use a scene view directive but
            need to <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/beta/sample-code/scene-webgl-support/index.html">gracefully handle</a>
            browsers that do not support WebGL. Most examples using the scene view directive
            also demonstrate how to use this binding.
